I recently relocated from Utah to Ohio with my husband and two cats. Not only did I uproot my life, I also transitioned from being a front end developer to being a remote software engineer at Prudential. With years of UI/UX focus, I am working to blend that skill set with Angular, NodeJS, React, and Java. I am an advocate for anyone getting involved in tech, learning new things, and helping others find their passion. I love art and am excited to create an at home studio in my new place, outdoors, traveling, and finding the best hole in the wall restaurants. Slowly but surely embracing my nerdy side. I can be bribed with chocolate.
